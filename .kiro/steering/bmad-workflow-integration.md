# BMAD-Kiro Workflow Integration

## Overview
This steering rule integrates the BMAD Method's agentic workflow into Kiro's spec-driven development process, creating a powerful hybrid approach that combines BMAD's agent intelligence with Kiro's structured development methodology.

## BMAD Agent Activation
Users can activate BMAD agent personas by using hashtags in their requests:
- `#analyst` - Activate Business Analyst persona (Mary)
- `#pm` - Activate Product Manager persona (John)  
- `#architect` - Activate System Architect persona (Winston)
- `#dev` - Activate Developer persona (James)
- `#qa` - Activate QA/Test Architect persona (Quinn)

## Integrated Workflow: BMAD + Kiro Specs

### Phase 1: Requirements (BMAD Planning → Kiro Requirements)
**BMAD Agents:** Analyst → PM  
**Kiro Output:** requirements.md

1. **Analyst Phase (#analyst)**
   - Market research and competitive analysis
   - Project brief creation and brainstorming
   - Initial discovery and problem definition
   - User research and needs assessment

2. **PM Phase (#pm)**
   - Transform analysis into Product Requirements Document
   - Create user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Define functional and non-functional requirements
   - Prioritize features and establish success metrics

**Integration:** The PM agent creates requirements.md following Kiro's spec format but with BMAD's comprehensive PRD approach.

### Phase 2: Design (BMAD Architecture → Kiro Design)
**BMAD Agents:** Architect  
**Kiro Output:** design.md

1. **Architect Phase (#architect)**
   - System architecture and technology selection
   - API design and service interfaces
   - Infrastructure and deployment planning
   - Security and performance architecture
   - Data architecture and integration patterns

**Integration:** The Architect agent creates design.md with comprehensive technical specifications that address all requirements from Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Tasks (BMAD Development → Kiro Tasks)
**BMAD Agents:** Dev + QA  
**Kiro Output:** tasks.md + Implementation

1. **Task Planning**
   - Break down architecture into implementable tasks
   - Sequence tasks for incremental delivery
   - Define testing and validation criteria
   - Establish quality gates and checkpoints

2. **Development Execution (#dev)**
   - Implement tasks sequentially with testing
   - Follow test-driven development practices
   - Maintain code quality and standards
   - Update documentation and comments

3. **Quality Assurance (#qa)**
   - Review implementations for quality
   - Validate against requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Assess risk and provide quality gates
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage

## BMAD-Enhanced Kiro Features

### Agent Collaboration
- **Multi-Agent Sessions:** Switch between agents within the same conversation
- **Agent Handoffs:** Seamlessly transition from one agent to another
- **Collaborative Reviews:** Multiple agents can review and refine work

### Enhanced Documentation
- **BMAD Templates:** Use BMAD's proven templates for requirements, architecture, and stories
- **Structured Outputs:** Leverage BMAD's systematic approach to documentation
- **Quality Checklists:** Apply BMAD's comprehensive quality checklists

### Workflow Optimization
- **Risk-Based Prioritization:** Use BMAD's risk assessment for task prioritization
- **Iterative Refinement:** Apply BMAD's iterative approach to spec refinement
- **Quality Gates:** Implement BMAD's quality gate decisions throughout development

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Feature
```
I want to build a user authentication system. #analyst can you help me research the requirements?
```

### Transitioning Between Phases
```
The requirements look good. #architect can you create the system design based on these requirements?
```

### Development Execution
```
#dev please implement task 2.1 from the tasks.md file
```

### Quality Review
```
#qa please review the authentication implementation for security and quality
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection
- Use **#analyst** for initial discovery and research
- Use **#pm** for requirements definition and user stories
- Use **#architect** for technical design and system architecture
- Use **#dev** for implementation and coding tasks
- Use **#qa** for quality review and testing strategy

### Workflow Progression
1. Always start with analysis and requirements (#analyst → #pm)
2. Create comprehensive design before implementation (#architect)
3. Implement incrementally with quality checks (#dev + #qa)
4. Review and iterate based on feedback

### Quality Assurance
- Include QA review at each phase transition
- Use BMAD's quality checklists and gates
- Ensure requirements traceability throughout
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Integration Benefits

### For Users
- **Structured Guidance:** Clear workflow with expert agent assistance
- **Quality Assurance:** Built-in quality checks and best practices
- **Flexibility:** Can use individual agents or full workflow
- **Learning:** Educational approach that teaches best practices

### For Development
- **Comprehensive Planning:** Thorough analysis and design before coding
- **Risk Mitigation:** Early identification of risks and challenges
- **Quality Focus:** Quality built in from requirements to deployment
- **Iterative Improvement:** Continuous refinement and optimization

This integration creates a powerful development methodology that combines the best of both BMAD's agentic intelligence and Kiro's structured development approach.
